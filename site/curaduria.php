                <h1>OUR PHILOSOPHY</h1>
                <p>
                    Our brand's uniqueness is crystallized by our tagline 'We Collect Rare People', which combines various
                    elements that are essential in our philosophy, Notably, the ideas of 'sharing passion' and 'community'
                    with 'rarity' and 'identity'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "We Collect Rare People", is a play on words, a sort of oxymoron, making people ask themselves about
                    who is collecting, What, why and whether they would like to join our 'club', or better, our 'family'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Czapek collects rare people in many ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First-of-all, Czapek collects rare supplying partners that provide the brand with rare savoir-faire, proud
                    to be a piece of this exciting project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Czapek also collects clients with a rare obsession for quality, on the quest for a unique product. In
                    another sense, they too become partners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Czapek collects as well few yet outstanding retail partners across the globe,
                </p>
                <p>
                    And last but not least, Czapek collects shareholders, fine watch lovers that have always dreamt of not
                    only being customers, but owners of an haute horology venture, and their dream became true thanks
                    to the crowdfunding equity campaign that made the revival of Czapek possible.
